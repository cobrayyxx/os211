# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual memory is a memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the main memory.
This website explain virtual memory completely, it tell us about benefit virtual memory, type of virtual memory, how virtual memory works.

2. [Caching](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/)<br>
Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data. 
This website tell us about how caching work and caching overview clearly.

3. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html#:~:text=Memory%20allocation%20is%20the%20process,of%20a%20structure%20or%20class.)<br>
Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory in a program to be used to store variables, and instances of structures and classes.
This website minim with UI but it serve us simple explanation that make us know the concept of memory allocation. 

4. [Virtual Address Space](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/virtual-address-space)<br>
The virtual address space for a process is the set of virtual memory addresses that it can use.
This website has many explanation virtual address and it tell us about Virtual Address Space for 32-bit Windows.

5. [Frame Allocation](https://www.techtud.com/short-notes/virtual-memory-frame-allocation-strategies-used-frame-allocation#:~:text=PRIORITY%20ALLOCATION%3A%20The%20processes%20with,replace%20processes%20with%20lower%20priorities.)<br>
Frame Allocation is algorithm helps us to decide no. of frames to be allocated to any process.
This website explain about several strategies used from Frame Allocation with an image, so it help us to understand more deeply.

6. [Global Allocation vs Local Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/#:~:text=Global%20replacement%3A%20When%20a%20process,take%20a%20frame%20from%20another.)<br>
The number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether you have used global replacement or local replacement for replacing pages in case of a page fault.
This article tell us about advantage and disadvantage each allocation briefly.

7. [Thrashing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4766/thrashing)<br>
Thrashing in computing is an issue caused when virtual memory is in use.
This article tell about how thrashing can occur and what's the effect of thrashing.

8. [NUMA](https://www.motioncontroltips.com/what-is-non-uniform-memory-access-in-industrial-controls/)<br>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a kind of memory architecture that allows a processor faster access to contents of memory than other traditional techniques.
This article have an illustration so we can understand, what's the differences between a NUMA and UMA.

9. [Demand Paging](http://digitalthinkerhelp.com/demand-paging-in-os-operating-system-examples-advantages-working/)<br>
Demand paging is a process of swapping in the Virtual Memory system.
This article explain a lot of things about demand paging, like How Does Demand Paging Working, Example of Demand Paging, etc.


10. [Kernel](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-kernel-in-operating-system-and-what-are-the-various-types-of-kernel)<br>
A Kernel is a computer program that is the heart and core of an Operating System.
This article tell us about types of kernel with illustration, advantage, and disadvantage.
