# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Deadlock and Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/#:~:text=Deadlock%20occurs%20when%20each%20process,held%20by%20any%20other%20process.&text=Hence%20both%20process%201%20and,get%20blocked%20for%20indefinite%20time.)<br>
Deadlock occurs when each process holds a resource and wait for other resource held by any other process and Starvation is the problem that occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time.
This article gives us illustration about deadlock process and table of difference between Deadlock and Starvation.

2. [Deadlock Characterization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/deadlock-characterization)<br>
A deadlock occurs if the four Coffman conditions hold true.
This website explain us 4 conditions clearly with an illustration, so we can easily understand.

3. [Bankers Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/#:~:text=The%20banker's%20algorithm%20is%20a,should%20be%20allowed%20to%20continue)<br>
The bankers algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an s-state check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
This article explains Banker's Algorithm so clearly and some example of code for bankers algorithm.


4. [Deadlock Prevention And Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
We can prevent Deadlock by eliminating any of the four conditions.
This article gives us an explanation about how to prevent deadlock for each characteristic.

5. [Race Conditions](https://devopedia.org/race-condition-software)<br>
Race condition in software is an undesirable event that can happen when multiple entities access or modify shared resources in a system.
This article explains race condition so clearly, because it explains about milestone, example of race condition, How to detect race condition in a program, etc.

6. [Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads.
This article not only gives us an explanation about semaphore but also implementation of binary semaphore and counting semaphore in programming.

7. [Petersons Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Petersons Algorithm is used to synchronize two processes.
This article gives us a problem that can be solved with peterson's algorithm and solution in C-language.

8. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer)<br>
Bounded Buffer problem is generalized in terms of the Producer-Consumer problem.
This article tell us about producer operation and consumer operation with pseudo code and some point to explain that code.

9. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/readers-writers-problem)<br>
The readers-writers problem relates to an object such as a file that is shared between multiple processes.
This article explains about reader process and writer process with pseudo-code, so we can have an illustration about that process. 

10. [Dining Philosophers Problem ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dining-philosophers-problem-dpp#:~:text=The%20dining%20philosophers%20problem%20states,and%20left%20chopstick%20to%20eat.)<br>
Dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.
This article gives us solution for this problem and some of the ways to avoid deadlock briefly .
