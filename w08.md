# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm#:~:text=The%20process%20scheduling%20is%20the,of%20a%20Multiprogramming%20operating%20systems.)<br>
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
This website explain about process scheduling queues with illustration and simple, so we can easily understand about it process.

2. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)<br>
Thread Scheduling is threads that involves two boundary scheduling, that is Scheduling of user level threads and Scheduling of kernel level threads.
This article tell us about the process of LWP step by step, so we can understand the concept. 

3. [Completely fair Scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/completely-fair-scheduler-cfs-and-brain-fuck-scheduler-bfs/)<br>
CFS is similar as ideal based scheduling instead it priorities each process according to there virtual run able time.
This article explain the concept of CFS so clearly, start from idea behind it, how CFS processing, etc.


4. [Real Time Scheduling](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs111/supp/realtime.html)<br>
A real-time system is one whose correctness depends on timing as well as functionality.
This article explain about Real-Time Systems and Real-Time Scheduling briefly.

5. [Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Asymmetric-Multiprocessing)<br>
Asymmetric multiprocessor systems are a part of multiprocessor systems along with symmetric multiprocessor systems.
This article explain about features of asymmetric multiprocessing with an illustrations and points.

6. [Two State Process Model](https://slaystudy.com/process-state-models-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Two%20State%20Process%20Model%20consists,Running%20State%3A%20Process%20currently%20executing.)<br>
Two State Process Model consists of not-running state and running state.
This article have an illustration to complement the explanation, so we can easily to understand.

7. [Three-state process model](https://www.louiewong.com/archives/251)<br>
Three-state process model is constituted of READY, RUNNING & WAITING.
This article explain this topic briefly, so it doesn't waste our time to read it.

8. [NUMA](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)<br>
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded.
This article gives us an overview about what is NUMA briefly.

9. [Multicore processor](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/multcore.htm#:~:text=A%20multicore%20processor%20is%20a,advantage%20of%20the%20unique%20architecture.)<br>
A multicore processor is a single computing component comprised of two or more CPUs that read and execute the actual program instructions.
This website gives us an information about multicore processor in short version, but you are still get the concept.

10. [Big O Notation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/)<br>
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
This article explain Big O completely, there are a lot of illustration, graph, etc.
