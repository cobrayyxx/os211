# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Concurrency](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/)<br>
Concurrency means multiple computations are happening at the same time. 
This article tell us about two models for concurrent programming clearly with illustration, so we can easily understand about this topic.

2. [Dispatcher vs Scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)<br>
Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways and dispatcher is a special program which comes into play after the scheduler.
This article tell the difference between dispatcher and scheduler by definition, types, dependency, algorithm, time taken, and function. 

3. [Multiprocessor Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Multiprocessor-Systems)<br>
multiprocessor are systems that have multiple processors working in parallel that share the computer clock, memory, bus, peripheral devices etc.
This article tell about types of multiprocessors, advantages of multiprocessor systems, and disadvantages of multiprocessor systems. 

4. [States of a Process in Operating Systems](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-a-process-in-operating-system-and-what-are-the-different-states-of-a-process)<br>
a Process is something that is currently under execution.
This article show the flow of a process from the new state to the terminated state.

5. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
This article have an illustration that show the flow of a process scheduling queues.

6. [Context Switching](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)<br>
Context Switching involves storing the context or state of a process so that it can be reloaded when required and execution can be resumed from the same point as earlier.
This article tell us anything about context switching briefly, start from Context Switching Triggers until Context Switching Cost.

7. [Cooperating Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cooperating-process)<br>
Cooperating processes are those that can affect or are affected by other processes running on the system.
This website tell us a method of cooperation with illustration that help us to understand.

8. [Thread](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multithreading)<br>
Thread is an execution unit that consists of its own program counter, a stack, and a set of registers.
This website tell us a lot of things about thread briefly. 

9. [Inter-process Communication ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/#:~:text=Inter%2Dprocess%20communication%20(IPC),Message%20passing)<br>
Inter-process communication (IPC) is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions.
This article gives us illustration of shared memory and message passing and some code about that.

10. [Remote Procedure Call](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/Remote-Procedure-Call-RPC)<br>
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. 
This article tells us about how does RPC work, types of RPC, advantages and disadvantages of RPC with clearly.
