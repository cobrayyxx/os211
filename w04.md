# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Address](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/terms/address)<br>
Address is a a way for the computer to know where to send its messages, and a way for the information or the device to know it is being called upon.
In this article gives information about definition and some type of address. 

2. [Memory Allocation](http://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html#:~:text=Memory%20allocation%20is%20the%20process,of%20a%20structure%20or%20class.)<br>
Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory in a program to be used to store variables, and instances of structures and classes. 
This article tell us about two basic types of memory allocation complete with example in programming.

3. [Hardware Address](https://www.askit.ttu.edu/portal/app/portlets/results/viewsolution.jsp?guest=0&solutionid=150827063105803&hypermediatext=null#:~:text=A%20hardware%20address%20is%20a,often%20assigned%20by%20the%20manufacturer.&text=The%20hardware%20address%20is%20sometimes,access%20control%20(MAC)%20address.)<br>
A hardware address is a unique identifier for a network adapter usually stored within the device itself, and it is most often assigned by the manufacturer.
This website tell us about hardware address definition with simple language and easy to understand.                                                                                                                         

4. [Address Binding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/#:~:text=Address%20binding%20is%20the%20process,that%20is%20loaded%20into%20memory).)<br>
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space.
This Article tell us about processes are mapped from disk to memory.

5. [Little and Big Endian](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)<br>
In little endian machines, last byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first and  big endian machines, first byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first.
This article tell us about little endian and big endian very clearly and there are some code that's used to explain this topic.

6. [Paging](https://medium.com/@esmerycornielle/memory-management-paging-43b85abe6d2f)<br>
Paging is a method of writing and reading data from a secondary storage(Drive) for use in primary storage(RAM).
This article tell us about how operating system reads data from blocks called pages very clearly.

7. [Linux Library](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)<br>
A library is a collection of pre-compiled pieces of code called functions.
This article gives us information about  differences between dynamic and static Libraries and also advantage and disadvantage both of them.

8. [Pointer to Pointer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointer_to_pointer.htm#:~:text=A%20pointer%20to%20a%20pointer,or%20a%20chain%20of%20pointers.&text=When%20we%20define%20a%20pointer,actual%20value%20as%20shown%20below.)<br>
A pointer to a pointer is defining pointer to  a pointer the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value.
This article teach us about how to implement it in C language.

9. [Memory Management Unit](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management-unit-MMU)<br>
A memory management unit (MMU) is a computer hardware component that handles all memory and caching operations associated with the processor.
There are three major categories of MMU like RAM, OS, and Application memory management.

10. [Multilevel Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Multilevel Paging is a paging scheme which consist of two or more levels of page tables in a hierarchical manner.
This article tell us about some formula to represent virtual addresses and some image that help us to understand clearly.
